## Notes for Implementation

This PRD is designed to be given to an LLM for step-by-step implementation. The LLM should:
1. Follow the phases sequentially
2. Make commits as specified
3. Generate realistic, human-like commit messages
4. Include minor refactoring and bug fix commits
5. Show natural development progression
6. Add TODO comments that get resolved later
7. Include some debugging commits
8. Make the commit history look authentic

Remember: The goal is to create a portfolio piece that demonstrates real-world development practices, not just functional code.
